# CoLo (Corporate Logistics Workplace Management)
Our group has decided to move forward with an Android Application. This app will allow its users to clock-in/out, be assigned projects, and have managers who can control certain aspects of the employees. The initial plan is to use a database like Firebase to hold all the user’s information and use Android Studio to develop the actual application. Languages used will most likely be Java or Kotlin depending on the needs of the application as we develop. 

Upon launching the app, the user would be met by a login page. After entering the user’s login and password, the application would check Firebase to see if the user is an employee or manager. Depending on the status of the login the user will be sent to their respected hub page. Displayed on this page would be buttons to navigate to a Clock-in page and a project page. If a manager, additional buttons would be displayed to control the employees. 

We are still in the beginning stages of deciding what all the features of the app will be and have started a Wants and Needs list. Also, we have created the below flow chart to show the direction that we are thinking the app could go. Such as having the manager be able to choose an employee and navigate through their pages
